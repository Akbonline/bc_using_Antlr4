How to compile and test:

antlr4 -no-listener -visitor Grammar.g4
javac Grammar*.java MainVisitor.java
echo "1+2" | java MainVisitor 

OR to use file as input

echo "$(cat test.txt)" | java MainVisitor

To display the tree:

grun Grammar expr -gui 

or

grun Grammar expr -tree


Not very user friendly right now, but mostly functional.

Changes:
- Went back to using a java parser(?) to override functions, it was too hard to implement everything based on the class example alone
-Should work with comments, basic expressions (variables are questionable), sqrt, boolean expressions with comparatives (>, <, >=, <=) (i.e. 1<2 returns 1 for true), sin, cosine, natural log, e^x

What doesn't work
- Not. As in !expr. Not sure how to implement this yet.
- Negatives, like -2+1.
- Precedence is questionable.
- Special expression "read"
